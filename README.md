Gameplay footage of a single stage in a prototype I developed for a working treasure hunting game with Unreal Engine blueprints. The objective is to find and collect as many treasure items as possible before the timer runs out. Treasure is spawned in various locations throughout the stage and sometimes hidden inside of boulders. This demo comprises of first-person gameplay, a basic HUD, destructible meshes, collectibles, and spawners.  

Smash the boulders and see what you find!
